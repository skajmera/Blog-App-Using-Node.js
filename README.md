# Blog-App-Using-Node.js
Created a simple blog app. User can sing-up and login and then post any post and also like or dislike the post  In this project, I have made a backend of a blog-app website using Express framework of NodeJS. I have also used JWT-authentication token to verify the if the user is valid or not.
